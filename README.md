# Basic-AI-Chatbot

A beginner-friendly AI chatbot designed for easy setup and development. It comes with built-in responses for general conversation and leverages the Gemini API to handle queries beyond its predefined scope

## üöÄ Features
- Simple and intuitive architecture for quick deployment
- Predefined responses for common interactions
- Gemini API integration for dynamic, intelligent replies
- Easy to extend and customize

## üîß Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository.
- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Add your Gemini API key to the .env file:
```GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not hardcode your API key directly into the source code. Use environment variables for security.
- Run bot.py to start the chatbot.


## üåê Web Chatbot (Flask)

You can now run the chatbot as a web app using Flask:

### How to Run the Web Chatbot

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install flask
   ```
Ignore this step if you have already installed requirements.txt


2. **Set your Gemini API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
Ignore this step if you had already created a .env file and set the API key

3. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - If port 5000 is busy, change the port in `app.py`:
     ```python
     app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
     ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you chose).
